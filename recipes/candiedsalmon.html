    <h3>This is a recipe that I used on other fish 
        and decided to try it on salmon. 
        Even my husband likes it and he is not a salmon fan.
    </h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Some butter</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>4 ounce of salmon</li>
        <li>3 large onions</li>
        <li>1 cup of white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup of brown sugar</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, 
            and grease the foil with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>Combine the onions, vinegar and brown sugar 
            in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring 
            occasionally until the sauce begins to caramelize, 
            about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt butter with garlic in a small skillet over medium 
            heat. Lay salmon fillets on the prepared baking sheet, 
            and brush with garlic butter. Pour the onion mixture over 
            the fillets.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until 
            the fish flakes easily. Cooking time may vary with the 
            thickness of your fillets.</li>
    </ol>
